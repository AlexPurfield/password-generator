# password-generator

# Expectations 
For this assignment we were asked to use our JavaScript knowledge to creat a random password generator. The Acceptance Criteria is as follows:
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
 
 # My Password Generator

 I very much enjoy JavaScript so far and enjioyed this project with the learning opportunities that came with it. The alerts, confirms, and prompts were easy enough to figure out- my main challenge in this assignment was figuring out how to structure the for loop and random characters in order to put together the random password. The main thing I learned from this assignment is to ask for help. I was struggling late one night and utilized the AskBCS tool in Slack the next day and they were able to help right away. Everything I needed help with was right on the cusp of working and just needed a second set of eyes on them. Overall, I feel I learned a lot about randomized outputs, for loops, and asking for help through this project.
